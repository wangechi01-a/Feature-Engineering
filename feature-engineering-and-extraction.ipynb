These techniques help in creating new features or extracting relevant information from raw data, which can significantly improve the performance of machine learning models. \n\nFeature engineering focuses on creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve predictive model performance. On the other hand, feature extraction involves reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining relevant information.\n\n**Objectives**\n* Enhance the predictive power of machine learning models\n* Reduce overfitting and improve model generalization\n* Capture relevant information from the data\n* Improve interpretability of the models\n* Use Cases\n* Predictive modeling\n* Pattern recognition\n* Anomaly detection\n* Recommendation systems\n* Natural language processing\n* Computer vision\n* Time series analysis\n\n**Examples of Datasets**\n* Titanic dataset (for classification)\n* Boston housing dataset (for regression)\n* Iris dataset (for classification)\n* MNIST dataset (for image classification)\n* Text datasets (e.g., IMDb movie reviews)\n\n# Feature Engineering Techniques:\n## Handling Missing Values:\n\nMissing values, often represented by NaN (Not a Number) or null, are a common challenge in data analysis. Here's a breakdown of techniques to handle them:\n\n1. **Deletion:**\nSimplest approach, removes rows or columns with missing values.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n* Small amount of missing data.\n* Missingness is random (MCAR - Missing Completely At Random).\n* Disadvantages:\n* Loses potentially valuable information.\n* Can bias results if missingness is not random (MNAR - Missing Not At Random).\n\n2. **Imputation:**\nReplaces missing values with estimated values.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n* When deletion is not feasible due to data loss.\n* Different imputation techniques work for different data types and missingness patterns.\n\n**Types of Imputation**:\n\n* Mean/Median/Mode Imputation: Replaces missing values with the mean, median, or most frequent value of the feature (for numerical and categorical features respectively).\n* Random Sample Imputation: Fills missing values with a random value from existing data points in the same feature.\n* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: Uses the values of the k nearest neighbors (data points most similar to the one with missing value) to estimate the missing value.\n* Model-based Imputation: Uses a machine learning model to predict missing values based on other features.\n\n3. **Feature Engineering with Missingness**:\n\nObjective: Utilizes missingness information to create new features.\nUse Cases: When missingness itself holds meaning (e.g., income not reported could indicate a certain income bracket).\nExample: Create a new binary feature \"income_missing\" to indicate if income data is missing.\n\n4. **Ignoring Missing Values**:\n\nObjective: Simplest for specific algorithms that can handle missing values natively.\nUse Cases: Limited, only for algorithms specifically designed to work with missing data (e.g., decision trees with specific handling mechanisms).\nDisadvantages: Not generally recommended, can lead to biased results.\n\n5. **Forward filling**: Propagate the last observed value forward along the sequence of observations to fill missing values.\nTime series data where missing values represent temporary interruptions or gaps in data collection.\nSurveys or questionnaires where respondents choose not to answer certain questions.\n\n6. **Backward filling**: Propagate the next observed value backward along the sequence of observations to fill missing values.\nTime series data where missing values represent temporary interruptions or gaps in data collection.\nSurveys or questionnaires where respondents choose not to answer certain questions.\n\n7. **Interpolation**:  Estimates missing values by using the values of surrounding data points. Preserves data and avoids deletion.\n\n**Types of Interpolation**:\n\n* Linear Interpolation: Fills the missing value with the average of the two nearest existing values.\n* Polynomial Interpolation: Fits a polynomial function through the surrounding data points and uses it to estimate the missing value.\n* Spline Interpolation: Uses piecewise polynomial functions to create a smoother fit than linear interpolation.\n\n**Suitability:**\n\n* Interpolation works best for continuous features with a predictable missingness pattern.\n* For categorical features or random missingness, it might introduce bias by assuming a specific relationship between data points.\n\n**The best approach depends on:**\n\n* Amount of missing data: Deletion might be acceptable for small amounts.\n* Missingness pattern: Random missingness (MCAR) allows for simpler techniques like deletion or mean imputation. Non-random missingness (MNAR) requires more sophisticated methods like KNN or model-based imputation.\n* Data type: Imputation techniques differ for numerical and categorical features.\n* Domain knowledge: Understanding the data and reasons for missingness can guide the choice of technique.\n\n**Remember:** There's no one-size-fits-all solution. Experiment with different techniques and evaluate their impact on model performance.\n\n##  Encoding Categorical Variables:\n\nUsed to convert categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. It ensures that categorical variables do not bias the model due to their non-numeric nature.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\n* Text data such as movie genres, product categories, or city names.\n* Nominal data such as gender, marital status, or education level.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* One-hot encoding: Convert categorical variables into binary vectors representing the presence or absence of each category.\n* Label encoding: Convert categorical labels into numerical representations using integer encoding.\n* Target encoding: Encode categorical variables based on the target variable's mean or frequency.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# One-hot encoding\nencoded_df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['categorical_column'])\n\n# Label encoding\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nle = LabelEncoder()\ndf['categorical_column'] = le.fit_transform(df['categorical_column'])\n\n# Target encoding\nimport category_encoders as ce\ntarget_encoder = ce.TargetEncoder(cols=['categorical_column'])\nencoded_df = target_encoder.fit_transform(df, df['target_column'])","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## Data Transformation:\n\nUse to transform features into a more suitable format for modeling or analysis.
