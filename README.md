# Feature-Engineering

Feature engineering and extraction are crucial steps in the data preprocessing phase of any data science or machine learning project. These techniques help in creating new features or extracting relevant information from raw data, which can significantly improve the performance of machine learning models.

Feature engineering focuses on creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve predictive model performance. On the other hand, feature extraction involves reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining relevant information.
